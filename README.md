# GardeningProject

How I expected the challenge to go.
I feel I have a reasonable understanding of the material covered but I was very apprehensive about pulling everything together to create a complete project as this is my first time doing it.

What went well?
In the beginning setting up my spring boot project and package structure and also linking and testing my databases that I set up the options of being able to choose from.

What didn't go as planned?
Configuration of the communication with my front end, there was a lot of trial and error involved.

Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
