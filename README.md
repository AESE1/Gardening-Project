# GardeningProject

How I expected the challenge to go.
I feel I have a reasonable understanding of the material covered but I was very apprehensive about pulling everything together to create a complete project as this is my first time doing it.

What went well?
In the beginning setting up my spring boot project and package structure and also linking and testing my databases that I set up with the options of being able to choose from two types of database.

CRUD testing through postman all passed. This is the reason id 5 is missing from the delete test.

What didn't go as planned?
Configuration of the communication with my front end, there was a lot of trial and error involved.

Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.

When encountering problems I tend to move on to another task which takes away from my flow of working which I find it difficult to get back into a rhythm. I need to try different approaches and decide if persisting with the same problem until a solution is achieved is the best way forward.

I struggled with linking the front end to the back end, I don't think enough time was given to us to learn java script to a strong level. Fetch API's is what ties it all together and I have a limited understanding of this in the time given. If it not for past recordings where example code was shared and also the help of Richard, I am unsure if I would have got the function to work in time.
